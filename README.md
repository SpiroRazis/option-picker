# option-picker

Some of the original ideas for this project were to use it to better learn Docker and to make it easier to use from the command line. 

As the first project I expected to eventually publish publically, most of the early effort was spent learning and establishing the program design. 

After a few false starts, the files with corresponding testing files work well.

Upon trying to build a tree structure for more dynamic option selection, perhaps as in a dialogue tree, I realized that there were some limitations to the original specification that need to be revised (and are currently noted in the Issues tab).
